    "\n",
    "**🎯 Project Objective**\n",
    "Demonstrate the differences between a custom Microsoft Entra role and a built-in role (User Administrator) by assigning each to a separate test user. Evaluate role boundaries, effective permissions, and visibility in the Microsoft Entra portal—simulated through detailed AI-guided steps and facsimile screenshots.\n",

    "**🔧 Scenario Setup**\n",
    "You are managing a tenant where two IT administrators have different responsibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice (custom role): Should only view user profile information without making changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bob (built-in role): Should manage users, including resets and assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will simulate the creation of Alice's custom role and compare her experience to Bob's with the User Administrator role.\n",
